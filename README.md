## Introduction
This is a live interview AI model that can take part in interviews in your place.
It is a simple chatbot that can answer questions related to your resume, ask questions to the interviewer in your behalf and save them for later use. 

It's powered by GPT-3.5 and uses your own avatar model from Ready Player Me.
